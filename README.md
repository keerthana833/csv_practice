# CSV practice

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly python scripts and sample datasets to practice handling CSV files.
It is part of my journey in mastering python fundamentals for data handling and building a strong foundation for future projects.

# Python structure
- "row_counter.py" --> Counts the number of rows in a CSV file.
- "column_counter.py" -->  Counts the number of columns in a CSV file.
- "csv_search.py" --> Searches for specific value in a CSV file.
- "update.py" --> Modifies entries in a CSV file.
- "practice_data.csv" --> Sample dataset for testing.
- "high_marks.csv" --> Example dataset with student marks.

# How to Run🚀

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using GitHub.
2. Navigate into the project folder ("csv_practice").
3. Run the scripts with python:
    -For counting rows,run "row_counter.py".
    -For counting columns,run "column_counter.py".
    -For searching values,run "csv_search.py".
    -For modifying entries,run "update.py".
